A very large troll with kevlar plated horns and a black facemask stands here.

~
LookDesc:$
He's gotta be close to three meters tall.  Maybe taller.  His muscles bulge
through his kevlar suit, which was crafted for a troll sized wearer. He blocks
the entry of anybody he sees as unfit for entrance into the club.  If you
ain't hot, you just ain't hot, and he won't let you in if you can't help keep
Hell hot.

Beauregard Craft was once a part-owner of Dante's. When his partners
discovered he was embezzling huge sums of money, and lying to them with his
serene poker-face (which had earned him the nickname Iceman to begin with),
they turned him into the ice-man of the Fifth Hell. He is so heavily taken
over by cyberware that it is only the machinery that still keeps him alive.
Sadly for him, these machines will continue to do so forever. Beauregard is no
more than a torso. His legs were removed and replaced with coils of wires and
hoses now hidden within the ice-toned plasticrete walls of the Fifth Hell. His
chest and arms are covered in blue metal plates from his waist and fingertips
all the way to his neck. Only his head shows. He is very pale and completely
bald. He looks around through glowing ice-blue cyber-eyes, though in truth he
is seeing the entire Fifth Hell through a network of mini-cameras hidden in
the walls.

A woman rocker stands here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Evenstar, unlike most rockers, has no flashy image.  She believes that if her
message is to have any meaning, her voice and appearance should be that of the
common people. Consequently she dresses in a rather plain manner, with jeans
and a leather jacket. She looks quite out of place here, but her status as a
musician has brought her here.

He looks like he's having a real good time.  That's Lunatyk, the famous
thrill-simsense star who sells his adrenaline to the masses.  Well known for
his exploits, jumping out of planes, bungee jumping over lava floes, and other
extreme stunts, recording every emotion and burst of adrenaline with his
simsense recorder, then making money for Unimedia Simsense with the high sales
of his sims.  His sims are one step short of BTL's, as they are done with
legal stunts, and the emotive range of his chips is within the natural, but
Lunatyk BTL's also exist, where the original chips have been adjusted.

losing her edge and selling completely out.  Pink Freud started as a modern
tech tribute band to Pink Floyd, but they found a groove and a style
completely all their own since then.
