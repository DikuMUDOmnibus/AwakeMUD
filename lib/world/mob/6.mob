Name:	a cab driver
RoomDesc:$
The driver spins his way through the city, happily puffing on a doobie. 

~
LookDesc:$
The Cab driver is pretty handsome. Ooooooh yesss! Ain't he pretty! Sweat, dirt
and city pollution cover his skin like a thirty day old clingfilm suit. He
reeks of dope smoke and soybeer, mixing with scum not worth your shite on a
bad day.

Name:	an elven cab driver
RoomDesc:$
The driver spins his way through the city, occasionally sipping his coffee. 

~
LookDesc:$
The cab driver is an elf, and kind of scruffy looking in a Alice Cooper sort
of way. He wears a black cabbie hat and has long black hair that is rarely if
ever combed.  He drives and acts with a little twitchiness, common to those
who are addicted to caffeine.

 Sherriff Barnum is here, grinning and nodding. 

~
LookDesc:$
You've heard about this guy and you don't like him. Sherriff Barnum is
renouned for his mistreatment of prisoners, and there are rumors about the
things that he likes to do to deckers. Especially to YOUNG deckers. He works
for UCAS, and rumor has it that they sent him in to break up a UB cell in
Pittsburgh, and that he succeeded single-handedly. The autopsy reports on the
former UB cultists were sealed...rumors are that he did "unspeakable things"
to the corpses. The thought of this guy doing these things to your corpse
sends shivers up your spine.
