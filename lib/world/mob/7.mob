A large troll is standing here.

LookDesc:$
Marvin Stubbins is almost a legend on the streets - mainly because he was one
of the best deckers around and just happened to be a troll.  Since he had an
unfortunate encounter with some Black IC, Marvin has been working as a fixer
on the streets.

Long silver white hair, and violet eyes, his appearance though unique is

clasp with an odd glow.  He wears an emerald ring on his right hand, and his
long silver hair is tied in a ponytail.  His shoes are black leather dress
shoes of an elegant and unique design.

The first thing you notice is the smell.  The smell of raw sewage, to the
exponentiation of itself, causes your lungs to clog and makes you cough.  You
gaze upon the creature, and it has scales, dripping and oozing with slime.  It
has twelve tentacles, perfectly smooth, scaly and slimy, with a hardened point
on the end of each.  Its eyes are a dull red, and it hisses as it gazes
around, looking for something, anything to destroy.
