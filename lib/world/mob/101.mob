LookDesc:$
Melvak Peeblas is world reknowned for his films that tackle the plight of the
Urban Troll and Ork. He is currently dressed in a dark blue suit with a
mixture of Gold, Orichalcum and Platinum jewelry hanging from all parts of his
body. A huge diamond pinky ring catches your attention fairly quickly though.
Atop his head rests a dark red fedora which contrasts nicely with his dark
blue suit. In his hand a martini glass can almost always be found.

LookDesc:$
A Asian Troll stands here with a assault cannon clenched in his left cyber
arm. Other signs this Troll has seen battle include the ragged scars around
both his obvious cyber eyes, several crude cyber replacement fingers on his
right hand and dozens of scars covering his body. Most look relatively fresh
and this combined with the nearly unreadable black and red tattoo on his right
bicep lead you to believe this was one of the Trog gangers who survived the OU
massacre.
