Notes: Sector types outside the matrix affect many things including what
       type of light there is during the night.  Sector types in the 
       matrix MUST be from BLUE to BLACK.  Matrix sector types are always
       universal in the system, so that a system with blue sectors will
       have blue sectors throughout it.  Remember that high security costs
       money, and lots of it, so generally, unless its a big corp, it won't
       be able to afford much more than GREEN.

Notes on creating mobs:
There are many things which will determine values to be used on a mob.
The important thing to remember is that the mud treats the mobs JUST LIKE
PLAYERS.  What this means is that they have skills, attributes, and eq,
and those things determine how well the mob will perform in any
situation.  To determine things such as attributes for the mob, consider
this.  The highest number any human can have in any attribute (without
cyber modification) is 6.  What does this mean?  It means if you have a
mob, that is human sized, and it has strength 6, you are telling the mud
it's as strong as, say, Conan the Barbarian.  That's strong!  6 is the
strongest a human can be naturally!  Obviously something like a bear on
the other hand would have a strength of 9 to 12.  Perhaps the best way to
let you all see what sort of values exist, I'll put the maximum values
for the different races and an animal or three.
               Human   Elf    Dwarf   Ork    Troll   Bear  Dragon   Bat
Body:            6      6       7      9      11       9     15      1
Quickness:       6      7       5      6       5       4      7      5
Strength:        6      6       8      8      10       9     40      0
Charisma:        6      8       6      5       4       -      4      -
Intelligence:    6      6       6      5       4       2      4      1
Willpower:       6      6       7      6       5       2      8      1
Essence:         6      6       6      6       6       6      8      6
Magic:           6      6       6      6       6       -      -      -
Reaction:        6      6       5      5       4       5      5      6
Another quick note is that a creature should NOT have a magic attribute
above 0 unless you want it to cast spells!
As far as skills are concerend, use your judgement.  They don't all have
to have skills but it's good if they have skills related to what they
do.  If it's a secretary, give it corporate etiquette of 4 or 5.  Here's
a list of how good the values really are.
Skill level:
     0         unlearned
     1         knows a little
     2         practiced
     3         average
     4         above average
     5         good
     6         excellent
     7         great
     8         superb
     9         expert
For a character to know something at level 9, they are basically an
expert if not THE expert in what they do.  However, certain mobs, say a
doctor for example, would HAVE to have biotech of at least 8 or more
(unless you want them to be a shoddy doctor!).
As far as mob flags and such are concerned, if you're not sure if it
needs it, don't put it!  Though this is a fantasy world, we want it to be
logical.  Characters shouldn't just be running around with 'magical'
abilities granted by the mud.  Alot of flags were created to give the
mobs a fighting chance, but this was needed for the old system.  Trust
me, mobs are deadly enough without extra protection (=.
