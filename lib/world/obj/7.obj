A gorgeous black Katana lies here, looking lethal even in idleness.~
LookDesc:$
Taepta'so is a beautifully crafted, *VERY* high-tech Katana.  It is about the
normal length for a Katana, and the handle is wrapped tightly in a bright red
cloth.  The hilt is an oval of sculpted titanium, with two oriental dragons
chasing eachother around the blade's base.  None of these features are very
impressive, however, when compared to the blade itself.  It appears to have
been forged in the traditional fashion, (Folded around four-hundred times,
according to rumor), but that is where the similarity ends.  Rather than being
steel, this Katana's blade is a super-tough titanium alloy, and was folded by
an expert craftsman.  After the blade's shape was finished, it had a design of
a single large oriental dragon standing on Japanese script etched on both
sides with acid.  The script speaks to anyone who can read it of a legend of a
sentient sword named Taepta'so, and claims that this sword, quenched three
times in the blood of thoroughly corrupted men, is a reincarnation of it.
After this treatment, the blade was bead-blasted and anodized black. Last, but
certainly not least, the blade was sharpened to a razor edge, leaving a
gleaming ribbing pattern along the gently curving edge.
