	Hoi.  Now some snot nosed upstart little punks in the sprawl
	think they know a lot about guns.  Well you could go try to
	learn how to shoot a pea shooter from one of these gangers,
	or you can come to me to show you the real drek on guns and
	ammo.  I've been in desert wars six times and have plenty
	a scar to vouch for my presence there.  I'm doing time in

^cSprawl Crosstraining^n
In our constant drive to better ourselves, many have asked of places
where schools can be found, and what to do when we got there.  Well,
new runners often find themselves at a place known as the Neophytic
Guild, that plug ugly little building south of the Space Needle.  This
place isn't the place to go for your novahot runners, but its a place
to start from.  I will introduce you to each of the trainers at the
Neophytic Guild, by their name and their specialties.

^cMessage Base/Mail System^n
Shadowland's Mail System is composed of multiple mailing stations.
Several exist within the area of the Northwest, including a mail
station in Tacoma at the mall, and a postal station in Portland,
Tir Tairngire.
Any basic text message can be relayed this way, through the Matrix.
There are also terminals for various topics, Special Interest Groups
(or SIGs) that access portions of the Shadowland network.  One of these
is the terminal that can be found at a bar called "Pook's Place", 
the Club Penumbra in Seattle, or the Afterlife Club in Tacoma.
(ooc:
The commands for using a postal station are at the post office, you
simply type 'mail <name>', write your letter, finish with the @ sign
on a new line, and off its sent.  To use a terminal, you type at
that terminal 'write <message topic>' and exit from it the same
way you would from a mail message, with a @ on a new line.  There
are OOC usage terminals at the Tacoma Mall, Neophyte Guild, and the
Pook's Place bar.)

(out of character note.  This is an in-character publication from
Shadowland Publications, an e-document that every aspiring runner
in the shadows would keep as their bible.  It is chock full of in
character data, on the world of Shadowrun.  If you want information
on Shadowrun itself, the Role Playing Game by FanPro and WizKids, LLC,
check out their official webpage at http://www.shadowrunrpg.com/ . to
view each section of the document, read <keyword> of each section,

help with the commands integral to the mud read the help files and
feel free to ask questions on the newbie channel until you are beyond
newbie grade (rep level 16).  This item is to function as a basic
'mini-sourcebook' of in character information that would be readily
available to any runner in the 'plex, as well as a few plot-tie ins
and pieces of information that fixer/conspirator immortals can use.
The level of reliability of the rumors and 'hot paydata' found in
this file, is up to the RP staff.  Reality contradicts itself, why
