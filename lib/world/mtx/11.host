Name:	Seattle LTG
Keywords:	Seattle LTG
Description:$
Before you floats a perfect representation of the city of Seattle. It sits
upon a huge floating stone, suspended above an endless void. The level of
detail is amazing; data streams zoom along the streets below, weaving in and
out of buildings. The Seattle LTG provides links to every number within
Seattle, and you can clearly see where the huge masses of data stream out of
the Renraku Arcology and the Mitsuhama Towers, amongst others.

Name:	Tacoma LTG
Keywords:	tacoma ltg
Description:$
You float above an idyllic cityscape; morning birds chirp loudly from the
roofs of glass and steel towers. Clean white fluffy clouds float by you, set
in an impossibly blue sky. What appears to be cars silently skimming through
the streets are actually data packets, hurrying between the myriad hosts that
comprise the Tacoma LTG.

Description:$
You fly over what seems to be a massive roadmap of the UCAS. It's a
three-dimensional version of the maps found in street directories, with major
cities and towns rising out of the otherwise flat plains. Detached from the
rest of the UCAS and floating high above the landscape is the Seattle
Metroplex.

Description:$
The sky of stars surrounds you, and a vast forest spans out in every direction
below you.  With a wave of your hand, you can see that the stars respond to
your motions, with a vague twinkling.  Storm clouds roll over parts of the
sky, indicative of the high security of this RTG.

Description:$
Surrounding you is a goliath, yet idealized and golden version of the Portland
skyline. Great bridges carry data over a river that carries much data itself.
Great towers, representative of the hosts inside, match their physical skyline
counterparts, especially the Telestrian Habitat and the TTB Tower. A sea of
stars fills the sky overhead, with storm clouds that fly over at high speed,
flashing lightning forebodingly.

Name:	Shadowland
Keywords:	shadowlands lands board
Description:$
Chaos reigns. Flashes of light and motion momentarily gain substance, then
abrupty fade into pitch darkness or explosions of light. Noises fly past you
and off into the maelstrom, so intense they can almost be felt, insane
wailings and famous quotes mingled together. And through all this, lines of
text appear and vanish, scrolling at impossible speeds, but freezing in place
as you observe them. The only constant among all this is a single ^Wsilver^n wire
that moves like a glittering serpent before abruptly vanishing at one end.

Keywords:	ooc board shadowlands shadow lands
Description:$
Bright trails of light spin up into the heavens, following immense fibre optic
cables anchored to the ground of circuitry below like impossibly tall trees.
Much smaller but still huge cables tangle between the main 'trunks', creating
a series of small landings, at which the cable has been peeled back and
impromptu dataports installed. A myriad of figures moves between these points,
soaking up what information they can. A single, bright ^Wsilver^n wire winds
between this all, back onto itself and simply fades out of existance.

Currents of fresh forest air hold you suspended above an idyllic island
setting. Trees of impossibly healthy green dot the landscape, which ranges
from forests down to beaches of impossibly clean sand. A small settlement of
wood and brick sits slightly west of the center, woodsmoke slowly curling into
the sky.
