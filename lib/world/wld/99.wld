Name:	Dunkelzahn's Lair
Desc:$
   A nice warm cave (flame breath is good for keeping a dragon cozy) deep in
the realm of Lake Louise, deep in the Rockies.  From the amount of riches
surrounding you, it is obvious that what the Big 'D' left in his will was but
a meager drop in the bucket.  Mountains of gold, jewels, and artifacts from
the Fourth World surround you.  Knowing dragons, you figure that it would be
far better not to touch a single thing.

Desc:$
   Nasty.  Dirty.  Filthy.  These are the words that come to mind as you walk
down Charlotte Street.  Not because of the actual street, but because of the
nasty hookers that walk up and down this street. The street is lit up with
neon signs saying "XXX Arcade," "Girls Girls Girls," and the like.

aiming to hit the nine ball in the corner pocket.  Watching him and holding a
