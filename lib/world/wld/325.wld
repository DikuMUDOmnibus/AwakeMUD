Name:	Harbour Avenue and Ridgeway Street
Desc:$
   Food wrappers, leaflets and the occasional dried leaf drift across the
cracked sidewalks of this none-too-clean intersection. A dry, cold breeze
whistles through the street, silenced occasionally by the distant rumbling of
factories along Seattle's outer skyline, and various cars from what seems like
another age pass quietly by.

Name:	Harbour Avenue
Desc:$
   Harbour Avenue runs north and south along the more desolate western edge of
downtown Seattle's industrial district. Many of the storefronts here are
boarded over, with the exception of what seems to be a thriving restaurant to
the west. A moderately busy bus station, which provides transportation to
other cities, is to the east.

   The brick walls on either side of the street look crumbled and battered
from a variety of street brawls and random graffitti. While a few have
attempted to clean up the neighbourhood, it's only a matter of time before
vandalism strikes again when the watchful aren't looking.

   The aroma of strangely exotic fruit and vegetables wafts lazily through the

corner. Customers seem to be frequent and happy to have at least one place to
find something decent to eat. While the average populace in the area hardly
looks healthy and nourished, the odd banana every now and then seems to keep
them on their feet.

the abandoned office blocks that used to populate the area are now homes to
flickering shapes around fire barrels.

ramen noodle stands sitting side by side with pizza carts and soy dog stands.
Neon signs are situated on the sides of the buildings, whose upper floors are
largely apartments, lofts, and low level offices, and whose lower floors are
storefronts.  You see billboards advertising things such as "Commuter TaxiCorp
is hiring, call (3206)35-101512" and "Starbucks Soykaf".  The traffic is
pretty thick, though the largest contributor to background noise is the
freeway close to here, running parallel to First.

Traffic is poorly managed and gets backed up quite often here, in close

spires of downtown's higher-density commercial sector, through an artist and
nightclub sector. Many of the city's more bohemian elements frequent the many
shops, clubs, and coffee holes that you find on the next two blocks east of
here, before reaching the portion of downtown populated by tall towers of
plasticrete and steel. A small neon sign above a doorway to the northeast
reads, "^RLe Cinema Vieux^n."

   First Street is a working-class stretch of the southeast commercial
district of downtown Seattle. It's a bunch of brick and plasticrete tenements,
stained with years worth of rain, and shopfronts on the first floor. There are
two newspaper vending boxes with the Seattle Times and Seattle Sun here, two
competing papers with different angles. Seattle Times is more hard news,
whereas the Seattle Sun is an unrepentant screamsheet or tabloid. The traffic
is thick to moderate here, and the air is full of the sound of a freeway
within close proximity. An open doorway to the east leads into a small brick
brownstone, its rather dirty plate glass window advertising a theatrical
supply shop.

   On the very western end of the southeast commercial district of Downtown
Seattle, this intersection, infamous throughout North America as the most
accident prone,  is full of a nightmare of jammed vehicles, speeders, and
places to be cut off.  Just west of here is the Intercity Five exit, and many
drivers forced to drive quickly down the exit, find themselves being forced to
stop abruptly after going down the offramp.  The traffic is stop and go at all
hours, the lights are poorly timed, and the smog is thick. On the sidewalks
are crowds of people in breathers and raincoats, to gird their lungs from the
smog and acid rain fumes.   A lost pet poster is plastered against the
stoplight pole.

carrying a ten lane freeway on top of it.  The exit onramp/offramp is to the
north of here, carrying traffic from this street to I-90 in a rather congested
traffic nightmare. Farther east, past the overpass is the northeast section of
Seattle, a dense commercial zone.

Name:	Broadway, under Intercity 90
Desc:$
   Broadway runs right under the massive ten lane freeway that separates the
northeast and southeast commercial sectors of Seattle.  Up near the top of the
embankment you see a few cardboard shelters made up by a few scruffy looking
squatters.  Graffiti covers the embankments, in Japanese and English, an
indicator of the gang activity prevalent all over the metroplex, despite Lone
Star's heavy presence in this area.

   The traffic gets thicker, yet picks up space as you get closer to Seattle.
From the elevated freeway you can see a very large portion of Seattle's
skyline.  The Space Needle, Renraku Arcology, and the more distant
Aztechnology Pyramid northeast of here stand tall, creating a panorama of
architecture.

Name:	Third Street
Desc:$
   Tall twenty story, drab gray prefab office buildings line this street here.
On the first stories of these are shops and small restaurants catering to a
myriad of foreign tastes.  Dumpsters full of trash are lined up at the curbs,
taking up most of the usual parking area.  There are parking meters spaced at
every parking spot, with signs that say "Two Hour Metered Parking".  The air
is thick with the smell of spice from the restaurants, drek from the trash,
stench from the smog, and fumes from the acid rain.  Traffic flows at a near
constant rate, excepting in peak hours when traffic is jammed.  There is a
PanicButton(tm) on a pole here.

   Whitman Road runs east to west through the southeast district of Downtown
Seattle, a commercial area.  Prefab office buildings with rather common
storefronts, including clothing outlets and media stores on their first floors
line the street.  People in breathers and rain jackets crowd the street, the
many colors of rain jackets striking to the eyes, a sharp contrast against the
thickly gray city.

light based on the street with more traffic.  It also has the secondary
function of recording every traffic violation and sending the trideo data of

you can turn left, the next lane you can turn right, the next lane you better
turn right or you will run into a curb on the other side of the street as you
get cut off, and so forth.

   A large portion of the traffic, both on the street and on the road seems
immediately drained from view, and sucked in towards the Seattle Center. Not
unlike the centrepiece of the downtown neighbourhood, it attracts both
residents and tourists alike, with its huge structure containing a wealth of
different restaurants, boutiques, and other consumer heavens. The wide
concrete square surrounding the center gives space to people to relax and
pause along the tree-lined promenades that lead you into the Center.  A two
story structure is dwarfed to the south, a plasticrete school of sorts.

   Seventh Street ends here, and routes the traffic back south a few blocks.
Spring Street meanwhile continues to trundle at a leisurely pace past various
shoe and handbag boutiques, all calmly nestled in the dull glow of opposing
restaurants and cafes.

   Just north of here, a huge expanse of the Arcology's surroundings and the
Expressway mesh together, obscuring the nearby district from view. Continuing
east, Spring Street heads towards the eastern edge of the city limits, slowly
sinking into the shade of larger office blocks away from the main shopping
neighbourhoods.

   The twin sides of the alley appear to be almost leaning in on you, and as
you gaze further upon the structures, such an assumption is not entirely
incorrect. While the office blocks and multiplex buildings that populate the
area are fairly well constructed by regulation, it's not uncommon for many of
them to need some significant repairs.

Name:	Gray Street Northeast
Desc:$
   Gray Street is the major thoroughfare that runs from the Aztechnology
complex to the Mitsuhama complex.  It is a very busy six lane boulevard full
of traffic at all hours.  The sidewalks are lined with busy people mostly
wageslaves wearing breathers and rain jackets of all colours.  Lone Star has a
heavy presence in this area, to grant the wageslaves a false sense of security
that will keep them productive. A tall parking garage to the north made of
steel and plasticrete creates a large eyesore.

   Here on the northeast sector of Seattle, it appears as if the gods of
architecture are in fierce competition, trying to create the largest, most
ungodly eyesores imaginable.  Traffic on the street level is thick at all
hours, with commuters and wage slaves running all about at the intersection,
stoplights changing per prompt of the GridGuide systems.  An array of security
cameras stand on top of the stoplight system, recording traffic violations and
sending them to Lone Star Security's traffic department.

large towering strongholds of wealth and power. A small building to the south

Large concrete high rise office buildings line the streets, with storefronts

Name:	North Eighth Street
Desc:$
   The heart of the corporate sector, Eighth Street between Broadway and
Espanoza Northeast runs right through the Wuxing Complex, two very high towers
that are only dwarfed by the Renraku Arcology and Aztechnology.  On the ground
level, a four lane street is thick with traffic, busses, and taxicabs, all
fighting to get up to the next block, whichever way they are headed.
Newsstands line up on each side of the street in fierce competition.  A food
service truck is set up selling meals during work hours.

   No matter what time of night or day, this grimy, brightly-lit building is
never empty. Travellers and their luggage occupy the cracked plastic seats or
wander aimlessly around the garage at the far eastern end of the station,
where buses pick up and drop off their passengers; station personnel sell
tickets and perform their other duties; bums try to look as if they have a
legitimate purpose. While travel to most cities is currently unavailable,
Hellhound's deal with the Portland Chamber of Commerce, which allows them to
provide service to and from Portland, is a huge advantage over other
companies. Hellhound was known by another name in the Fifth World; the change
aside, the company continues to work hard to provide the working class with a
way to travel.

Name:	A Cubicle
Desc:$
   This small space has been designed to provide maximum work efficiency in
minimum area. The built-in table has barely enough room for an
expensive-looking computer, a small phone and a tiny writing space; the
printer sits underneath, next to a small filing cabinet. Shelves line the rest
of the cubicle walls, and are filled with books, old-fashioned ledgers and
datadisks. The office chair is small, but comfortable-looking.

Name:	A Unisex Bathroom
Desc:$
   This small, bright bathroom is just large enough for a urinal, a single
toilet stall and a small porcelain sink, this last set into a synthmarble
counter. A halogen light in the center of the ceiling casts a warm glow over
the clean, shiny fixtures.

   This is a small, simple alcove off the main reception area. A halogen
ceiling light casts a yellow glow over the synthwood-panelled walls and the
blue industrial carpeting that covers the floor and stairs. A flight of stairs
leads up, and the reception area proper is to the west.

Name:	A Corridor
Desc:$
   This short corridor is fairly nondescript - same wood-panelled walls,
stucco ceiling and blue-carpeted floor. Halogen ceiling lights illuminate the
area brightly, but not harshly. Doors lead north, west and south, and a
stairway is to the east.

Name:	A Conference Room
Desc:$
   Decorated in the same wood panelling, blue carpets and fluorescent lights
as the rest of the office, this small conference room is dominated by a white
oval table and 14 synthleather chairs. A projection screen runs the length of
the west wall, and the floor-to-ceiling window on that takes up the entire
south wall provides a comprehensive view of the street.

Name:	A Large Office
Desc:$
   This large room is furnished in a mixture of the functional and the
ostentatious. The utilitarian blue carpeting and synthwood panelling of the
rest of the building is present here, but so is a large, ornately-carved
marble desk with curving bronze legs. The office chair behind it is a plush
leather affair, but the two chairs in front of it are ornate Queen Annes with
curvy brass bodies and red upholstery. What seem to be genuine oakwood
bookshelves line the north wall, and cream Venetian blinds cover the large
picture window to the west.

Name:	A Small Anteroom

   This small, narrow area is a cross between a corridor and a room. The soft
halogen lights have been replaced by harsh fluorescence; the blue industrial
carpeting, by shiny tiles. A small wooden desk sits in the middle, next to a
sort-of metal doorframe - probably a scanner of some sort. To the north stands
a sturdy-looking metal door.

   Fluorescent ceiling lights cast a harsh yellow glare over the bare walls
and white-tiled floor of this small, chilly room. A plain white synthwood desk
and matching office chair occupy the room's center. A large, state-of-the-art
computer sits on a desk, and seems to be connected to a dataport in the
northwest corner. A security camera with a small radar dish mounted above it
has been mounted in the northeast corner of the ceiling.

   Here you are, outside the conference room window. Both the window ledge and
the ivy that covers the building provide a fair amount of footholds,
handholds, and grappling hook room. The brick facade of the building is faded
red and streaked with the mementoes of many Seattle rains. The street lies
below, and the conference room is to the north.
