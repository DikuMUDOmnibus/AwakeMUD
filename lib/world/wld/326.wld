#32600
Name:	Broadway, under Intercity 90
Desc:$
   Broadway runs right under the massive ten lane freeway that separates the
northeast and southeast commercial sectors of Seattle.  Up near the top of the
embankment you see a few cardboard shelters made up by a few scruffy looking
squatters.  Graffiti covers the embankments, in Japanese and English, an
indicator of the gang activity prevalent all over the metroplex, despite Lone
Star's heavy presence in this area.

   The traffic gets thicker, yet picks up space as you get closer to Seattle.
From the elevated freeway you can see a very large portion of Seattle's
skyline.  The Space Needle, Renraku Arcology, and the more distant
Aztechnology Pyramid northeast of here stand tall, creating a panorama of
architecture.

Desc:$
   Third and Ridgeway, to major streets meet here at a very busy intersection
with a complex stoplight and crosswalk system in place.  There are security
cams that monitor traffic with motion sensors, and delegate who gets the green
light based on the street with more traffic.  It also has the secondary
function of recording every traffic violation and sending the trideo data of
every incident to Lone Star Security.

you can turn left, the next lane you can turn right, the next lane you better
turn right or you will run into a curb on the other side of the street as you

Desc:$
   Espanoza Way curls northwards, sneaking under the shadow the highway above.
The gigantic concrete supports send off the odd vibration of massive cargo
trucks passing overheard at speed, and the sidewalk is coated in an almost
dusty mist.

Name:	Ridgeway at Seattle Center
Desc:$
   A large portion of the traffic, both on the street and on the road seems
immediately drained from view, and sucked in towards the Seattle Center. Not
unlike the centrepiece of the downtown neighbourhood, it attracts both
residents and tourists alike, with its huge structure containing a wealth of
different restaurants, boutiques, and other consumer heavens. The wide
concrete square surrounding the center gives space to people to relax and
pause along the tree-lined promenades that lead you into the Center.  A two
story structure is dwarfed to the south, a plasticrete school of sorts.
