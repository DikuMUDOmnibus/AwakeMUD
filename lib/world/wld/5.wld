   lasteel windows stretch from both sides of the floor and join in the middle
of the roof providing a clear view of your surroundings.  White, cushioned
seats line the middle facing towards the windows while the seats along the
sides face both front and back.  Light green floors and bordered doors add an
unimaginative touch to the decor.  Doors line each car on the east and west.
