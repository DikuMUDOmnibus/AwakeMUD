Name:	A Jail Cell
Desc:$
      Ah the jail cell of the future! This model comes complete with a pair of
rancid open air toilets, a ripped up pair of bunk beds, and photos of nude
women, from orks and trolls to humans theres pictures of the comely ladies
plastered all over the concrete walls. In between one layer of concrete and
the next there is a fungus growing to provide a living wall in order to keep
all astral instruders out. Multiple spell barriers have been set up in the
area to keep all you awakened folks from trying something funny, course this
doesn't stop the bored looking fire elemental who rests deep in the astral up
in the corner of the cell watching you with disinterest. The door is made out
of a super strong steel alloy thats also been layered with fungus. A moss
covered vent has been covered with a steel plating with holes poked into it in
order that a slight amount of air manages to come into the room. It is all in
all a hot and muggy room full of the smells of dried gore, urine, feces, body
odor and vomit. Your cell mate is a large dermal deposit covered troll who is
currently smiling at you in a really weird way. Do try not to bend over too
much..

Name:	Dead Man, Inc. Headquarters
Desc:$
   This room is decorated in an odd, victorian/goth/fantasy art style, with
black and white marble walls, and silver-gilded accents.  A carved oak shelf
runs around the perimeter of the ceiling, housing gargoyles, dragons, and
various other statuary and knick-knacks.  The floor is tiled in the same
marble.  Lighting fixtures in ornately cast silver project evenly spaced along
the walls.  The ceiling is plaster.  If you chance to turn out the lights, you
notice that someone has painstakingly duplicated the constellations with small
dots of glow-in-the-dark paint on the ceiling.  There is a comforting odor of
stale incense, machine oil, and someone's good cooking.
   Several areas of the room appear to be devoted to various works in progress
-- in one cornor, a frankenstein's monstor of a computer sits, dysfunctional
but impressive, surrounded by parts, mangled decks, wiring, tools, and other
bits of detritous.  In another cornor lies, a variety of weapons in various
states of disassembly, cleaning, and repair.  A third corner houses ornate
tapestries, small tables and closed chests surrounded by candles and jars
containing unidentifiable items.  The fourth is scattered with animal parts,
found items, and other bits of natural material seldom seen in the heart of a
city, with more candles, chests full of items, and small tables.
   The center of the HQ houses a more ordinary relaxation and entertainment
area, with leather sectional couches arranged around a trid set, and a stereo
system.  Various games and movie chips litter the area, as do a variety of
magazines.  You see 2600, Bud K, and others that survived the Awakening as
well as a variety of newer publications.
   Behind this area are a variety of bedding arrangements -- cots, mattresses,
blankets and pillows.  Between the couches and the beds sits a large heating
unit with ducts extending up through the ceiling, a stove and oven, and a
fridge.

Name:	A dank, dilapidated loft
Desc:$
   A small loft in a tenement with a leaky wooden ceiling. Wooden beams hold
the ceiling up though they are cracked and greatly worn. Roaches scurry across
the rotting linoleum floor and the smell of raw sewage fills the room. The
sound of leaking water fills the air. A Concrete Dreams poster hangs on the
northern wall and next to that is the elven screech-rock band Speed Coma's
2049 Tour poster, both looking tattered and torn. Beer bottles and spent
simsense chips are strewn everywhere and half-soaked matresses line the
western wall. A trid set with rabbit-ear antennae buzzes softly on the eastern
wall and an elf in Ancients colors watches a talk show zonked out of his
gourd.

   The first thing you notice upon entering is the smell of cigarette smoke,
thickly floating in a cloud about head level.  There are tables arranged all
throughout this cozy-looking, neatly arranged, if somewhat un-posh room. Signs
appear all over the wall, each with a one liner, offering wisdom on the way
life really is.  Surrounding the tables are various chairs, with ashtrays
arranged at various intervals. Everything mounted on the wall, as well as the
walls themselves are coated in a thin film of nicotine stains.  You hear in a
small room in the back the sounds of a coffee pot churning.

Name:	OMEGA Central Headquarters
Desc:$
   You've entered the assumed omega headquarters. You aren't quite sure as if
by heat or motion  sensors, however you are suddenly inspected by a rain of
lasers they are evaluating you, determining  your worth. The antechamber you
stand  in is expansive, full up of trid screens and racks of computer
components. In front of each station is a well worn but very comfortable
looking chair. Scribbled in  various areas- walls, celing and floor alike, are
various number clusters, code strings ranging from  simple to very complex and
technical, and algorhthns. You can smell the faint scent of silicon clinging
to the air, underneath that however is a sweeter undertone... Honey? You can't
be sure. All you can hear is the faint humming of the various equipments and
the duller buzzing of the cirulation fans. There  is a jumble of lockers on
the far left wall, labled not with names, but rather with numbers. Overall the
scene is one of organised chaos, cluttered, yet there is a decided lack of any
trash or dirt.  The most appealing part of the room is the farthest corner
nook. It has a very apparent femanine  touch. There are two large and very
appealing looking overstuffed chairs here, between them a large  elegant end
table. On this end table is an ash tray,  a vase of silk fowers and an old
antique lamp. Well worn novels and manuals are piled up on both sides of both
chairs, and there are some very  plush looking pillows strewn about.  Rather
than the flourecent lighting found in the main part of the  antechamber this
area has several beatuiful candelabras with much apparent use hung from the
walls, and sconces with breath taking trinkets on display adorning the walls.
Only one string of code is  found here, and it is centered between the two
chairs, it reads 09./12.15.22.05./25.15.21. Before you go about your business
you note a damp looking hall way to your right, lighting very dim  and
seemingly flickering. There are several doors to either side of the hall, and
at the end a set of very  heavy looking and attractive double doors. Through
the murk you can see a hand painted sign in  immaculate script forbidding
entry to anyone other than Dev or Pandora Null. Turning your attentions back
to the antechamber, you enter.

something as an airlock, preventing unauthorized access.

Name:	The Circle of Kai-shiin
Desc:$
   An abandoned library with a strong background count that seems to fill the
room with a strong empowering static.  The walls,  high vaulted ceiling and
pillars are made of real gray marble, normally highly  polished; they have now
been decorated with shamanic symbols of the various  totems. This room is
circular with a very powerful hermetic circle permanently  inscribed in the
floor. Over to the side is the remains of what used to be a  fairly impressive
hardcopy hermetic library. It looks as if the more expensive collections have
been sold off, not far from the library is a bunch of  shamanic equipment.
Looks like some of the library was sold and used to buy  that.  Around the
room are a bunch of couches for lounging and relaxing.  The air here has the
slight musk smell associated with animals, reptiles in  particular.  On the
wall is a huge map of Seattle and next to it pictures of  elves that have gone
missing under mysterious circumstances.

Name:	Dark Paladins' Sleeping Area
Desc:$
   This part of the hall has been redone, but still contain the marble dcor of
the main hall, but instead of being covered with shamanic symbols they are
covered with hermetic designs.. Formerly it used to have apartments and some
alcoves. Now the apartments have been taken out and more alcoves added, and
the current ones expanded. The alcoves have heavy sound absorbing curtains to
ensure privacy.  A typical example of an alcove has a very comfortable futon,
a closet and a small desk/workspace for those who have their own hobbies and
projects to pursue them.

Name:	A Masonic Temple
Desc:$
   A waft of incense smoke floats past your nostrils.  In the center of the
room is a huge globe, made with solid gold.  The temple walls are high, with
windows etched in Egyptian hieroglyphics.  A magical circle is drawn on the
floor of the south end of the vast temple, and on the north end is a medicine
lodge, followed by an altar the shape of an Egyptian pyramid. A kabbalic Tree
of Life tapestry hangs on the north wall.

Desc:$
   You are in a small but clean space.  It seems that someone has build a
secret room here; that would account for the odd 'L' shape of the room - it
has to fit in with the legitimate rooms of the structure.  There is a large
bed against one wall, as well as innumerable shelves and tables full of stuff.
There is a small crawlspace to the north that must lead to another part of
the bolthole.

Desc:$
   Roswell Security is a corporate arm of the Draco Foundation, designated for
investigation of bizarre sets of circumstances that threaten the continuity of
the world.  The office is arranged neatly, with a fully stocked bar, and a
noveau-chic desk with a computer console with the highest definition trideo
screen money can't buy.  Upon the wall facing the desk, are trideo screens
with many parts of the world in focus, many of which are "denied existence".
Anywhere Roswell Security sniffs something being out of place, a camera can
zoom into them within moments.  Roswell Security is the true "Big Brother" of
the Sixth World.
