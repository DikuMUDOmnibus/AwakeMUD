Desc:$
   Surrounding you in all directions are giant steel and glass towers,
reminders of the corporate powers in control.  Ahead of you there is a large
building, though not the largest in Seattle, very unique.  It appears to be a
giant Aztec step pyramid, built in this modern time.

finally approach the Reception and Information Center.  You see a large
circular desk staffed by eight secretaries working hard, as Aztech has no
qualms about overworking their wage slaves to near exaustion for very little
nuyen.  Probably make more nuyen running the shadows if they could gather the
bravery, and had the skills.  Several armed agents of Aztechnology are nearby,
just to make sure that the corporate order is well maintained.

   Shoppers, shoppers and more shoppers make this area a very crowded place.
To your north, a store catches your eye.  A large sign made with the latest
holographic technology reads Hugo's Sports Emporium.  Near you is a bench
sitting by a planter with a small Joshua tree inside of it.  By the planter is
a waste paper basket.
