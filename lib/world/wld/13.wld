   Tacoma spreads outwards to the west and east, truck stops giving way to
shopping centers and residential areas where, going up and down the roller
coaster of overpasses that runs through the city, tiny people can be made out
going about their lives.

   After changing lanes with a quick swerve and fervent prayer, the caravan of
8-wheelers is now a few cars behind, and a distance overpass with large green
signs can be barely made out up ahead.  Overhead is the overpass for East
Anselm Street, a major thoroughfare through East Tacoma.  An offramp takes
traffic up onto the street above.

There are orange construction cones and a few stray concrete pylons preventing

hard hats taking a break to glare at the rushing traffic.

though the drivers want to escape this desolate graveyard as quickly as

mess of run down businesses, houses and apartments.  Traffic runs by,
oblivious to those waiting on the ramp to get onto the freeway.

   You are surrounded by a great number of cars, lining the whole lot from
front to back, of more makes and models than most would ever dream.  Ford.
Isuzu.  Mitsubishi.  Dodge.  Toyota.  Aztechnology.  Its all there, and its
all for sale.  There is a crazy ork in a plaid zoot-suit walking up and down
the lot, with a huge grin on his face.
