   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of
physical matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the
relative darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.
   There is a "No Tipping" notice pinned to the darkness.

   There are Japanese Schoolgirl Lolitas everywhere!  Dancing around and
stuff. There are Tentacled Beasts everywhere!  And robotic monsters who plan
to destroy all so some hentai flick will have a so-called plot.  But mostly
what its all about is schoolgirls being seduced by tentacled beasts.  There's
also a shrine to Jerry Garcia on the far end of the room, with a copy of the
Koran on the altar.

Name:	Dunk's Room
Desc:$
   You enter an office made entirely out of finely veneered wood, with
orichalcum trimmings and ornimentation.  Above a mantle over a fireplace rests
an ancient katana, crafted by Masamune, the master blacksmith of legend.  In a
frame sitting on a wall behind a large oaken desk, is some words of wisdom.
The floor is made of some very ornately designed ancient rugs, made by master
weavers in ancient times, with names long forgotten.  On one end of the room
is a window, with a view of Mount Shasta, an ancient volcano whose mystical
beauty is of great renown.  A portal on the south side of the room is open to
the Seattle Center, and is a means to get back quickly into the sprawl.

Name:	Flynn's Workshop
Desc:$
   Instead of a room, which most people expect, you enter what looks like
another world.  You stand on a beach looking out to a beautiful ocean, and
oddly enough, the door you came from is in the middle of a jungle.  There is a
smooth white piano on the shore of the beach with wires plugged directly into
the sand.  It would seem that Flynn creates the fabric of the universe through
a simple tool, the piano.  Music from Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata fills the
air.

middle of the room, and a stairway leads down to the rest of the immortal
realm.  At the eastside of the room, on the wall, is an oldschool bulletin
board used to keep job postings and applications.  To the north is a black
looking hole in the wall, possibly a portal to another dimension?

   Before you spreads a small boating dock.  Wooden planks supported by tree
thick columns feel sturdy beneath your feet.  The dock continues about a
hundred feet north over the ocean leading to a single boat at the far end.
Water laps tranquily beneath the dock with a gentle breeze.

Name:	The Cabin
Desc:$
   Inside this cabin reside the bare necessities for life at sea.  On one side
there is a table for meals surrounded by padded benches which can further
serve as small cots.  On the other side however is a comfortable looking bed
large enough for two people with enough head room to sit.  Along one wall is a
sink and kitchen area while the other wall has a tiny, but functional toilet
enclosed in closet.  Next that closet is a larger storage closet housing
everything from clothing to supplies.  The decoration is somewhat sparse
though a large world map is on one wall marking the journey of this ship and
crew.  One thing is certain--living on this boat would require you to spend
alot of time very close to the other person.

   The sunwarmed deck beckons to you to stretch out upon its length. An
oversized beach towel has been spread out across the deck and looks as if
someone had just been using it to sunbathe on. The boat rocks softly back and
forth in the gentle waves and the soft sound of the water on the boat mingles
with that of the seabirds overhead.  A Northeast wind blows softly across the
water, cooling you in the afternoon heat.

Name:	Phrodo's Lair
Desc:$
   Welcome to Phrodo's Office... there are ficus trees everywhere, and a large
vidscreen on the far wall. You also notice a large floor to ceiling aquarium
in the corner fo the room, filled with exotic fish. The floors are marble, and
the desk is mahagony, with a Fairlight Excalibur built into the side of it...
It would appear that being an imp pays rather well.

Name:	The Hall of Nyarlathotep
Desc:$
   A massive hall, at least a hundred meters from end to end, this room is a
combination of splendour and the bizarre.  The floor is highly polished
obsidian, so black and shiny you can see infinity if you look too deeply.  The
walls are mahogany paneled with ornate window frames bearing stained glass
windows, some of which depict the most unspeakable creatures, are all at least
extremely bizarre.  The ceiling is a gigantic bas relief in sandstone,
carrying many of the same images of the windows, though they are much more
difficult to follow.  Tentacles are plentiful.  The ceiling, and the sandstone
columns carven with strange writing that hold it up, are both equally obvious
that they are not the work of human hands.  Hanging from the pillars are
golden braziers with brass bowls.  The smoke given off has no odor, but it
makes one feel vaguely ill to breathe it.  At the head of the room, across
from the giant oak double doors, is a large throne made of a strange greenish
material not unlike soapstone, but with golden flecks throughout the material.
It is also carven with ornate designs, and while most of them are not
identifiable, those that are make you wish none of them were.  It, like the
pillars, is also clearly not the work of human hands.

Name:	Rifkin's Diningroom
Desc:$
   This is a room of glass, tread lightly, for one wrong step could be the
end.  Beautiful, yes, yet fragile, easily broken.  Sun shines in, is blinds
and burns, darkness, sets over, and comsumes, Isn't it great to live in a
glass cube?
   A large table sits in the middle of this room, holding nothing upon it.  It
just sits there unused, gleaming, such a shiny finish.  Chairs surround it,
all shiny from a glossy finish,  all with cloth seat covers.  Everything is
perfectly set up, with compulsive neatness.  There is light from a sparkling
chandelier, which is set to give off dim amounts of light.   The rug is
Persian, made of the finest materials, coming from Persia.  Its background is
blue and depicts the slaying of Dunkelzahn.  A picture of the mighty dragon is
here on the wall, reminding all of who he once was, making his presence in the
room, strong and forceful.  He watches over.

lightbulb hangs from the curved ceiling and spots of blood dot the floor and
the many razorblades scattered around the room. This doesn't look like a happy

most the light from outside.

you just saw through the sifting sands. The sky faded in and out, into
nothingness. Your eyes ache as they try to catch fleeting images that display
in the sand, water and sky. Images of space, an electronic world, Seattle, and
a void. Or so it seems.

the pitch black sky is lit up by thousands of bright stars. The stars light up
some of the mountains, and you see silhouettes of snow covered tops against
the dark red western horizon. Sound cannot reach this place, and it's very
peaceful and relaxing, almost like you're in another world.

   You're in a large room filled with desks and shelves full of old style
personal computers, music equipment, compact discs and books. A small unkempt
bed dominates the center of the room while the floor seems to be carpeted with
clothes that have been randomnly strewn about. The monitors attached to the
PC's on the shelves are all tuned to white noise. One, alone in a corner by
itself, displays the Windows 2000 login screen proudly, but doesn't seem to
have a network connection. In other spots along the wall you notice a few
amplifiers with various wireless connections to a red guitar in the corner of
the room opposite the Windows 2000 machine. The books on the shelves vary, as
do the CD's. Everything from William Gibson to Tolkien lines the book areas,
and the CD labels list things such as Cky, Nirvana, The Offspring, The
Bloodhoung Gang, Slipknot, Murderdolls, HIM and on and on.

finger over the bindings of the books, noting subjects on Wicca, old movies,
Harry Potter, and ever a few that look to be unlabeled, even bound in loose
leather. A little hammock-chair is suspended in one corner, looking quite
inviting. The entire room smells of tree sap and incense, which puts you into

ASIST technology to primers on running a punchcard-based mainframe computer
from the 1960's.

Name:	Twiggys Room
Desc:$
   Darkness surrounds, and terror follows.  The feeling of light is fading
from you quickly, and soon another scream cries for releaf from somewhere in
the darkness.  Hope, there is none, pleasure, non existant.  An eeriee green
glow kicks up and you see bodies, not dead ones but suffering live people,
dangling from chains, and needles or rings inserted in various parts of their
body.  Low moans accompany their obvious suffering, and woe.  Still as the
light brightens, you see teeth marks on their flesh, and places where the whip
has also bitten through the tender skin. In the middle of it all, there is a
place, with blood stained feathers around it, that looks to be the resting
place of their torturer.

Name:	A Simple Garden
Desc:$
   Somewhere in the most distant reaches of the most distant metaplanes, is a
simple garden.  There are no fancy or exotic plants or flowers, but there are
daffodils, roses, and various vegetables.
   The sections of this garden are very orderly and neat.  The tomatoes,
carrots, peas, onions, garlic, and herbs are all very neatly in their
sections.  A simple faucet with a simple garden hose with a spray nozzle sits
at the edge of the garden, for the use of watering the garden.
