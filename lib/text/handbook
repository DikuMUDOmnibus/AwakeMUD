^Wo^n Cheating will not be tolerated.  If you don't know 
what cheating is, then you shouldn't be staff.

^Wo^n Flaming and infighting on public channels 
(immortal, ooc, etc) is expressly forbidden for immortals.  

^Wo^n Building is done on port 4400, the building 
port.  Over there, the rules are more lax, as long 
as work is done.  Its pure development with no RP staff.

^Wo^n Permdeath decisions are always voluntary on 
the part of the player victim of permdeath.  If 
they say no it doesn't go, i'm not permdead, then 
they are not permdead.  If they agree to go on a 
run where permdeath is a possibility, only then 
they can not argue against it, when it occurs.

^Wo^n Implementor responsibilities are shared 
between the Head Coder, the Head Builder, and 
the Head Gamemaster.  When two implementors 
disagree, a third must strike a balance with them.  
Majority rules in this tribunal amongst these three.

^Wo^n The Implementor in charge of each department 
can fire any of their staff for any reason, this is 
not up to debate, save for when abuse of power is 
an issue.  Then it is the responsibility of the other 
two members of the tribunal to overrule such decision.

^Wo^n Staff members are free to their opinions, but if 
a fundamental disagreement occurs, it is to be delegated 
to off-public channels (including wiztalk).  If it gets 
out of hand, implementors may be tasked to fire staff 
members who instigate these conflicts.

^Wo^n Any violation of above rules is grounds for 
immediate and permanent termination.
