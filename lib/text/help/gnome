GNOMES

Members of the gnome subgroup inhabit Central Europe and Asia Minor.
Gnomes are distinguished from other dwarves by longer noses and a
shorter, more childlike physique.  Gnomes tend to favor rural
environments over urban settings.  Most cling to the behaviours
traditionally attributed to their race by mythology and seem
unnerved by modern technology.  All known magical gnomes are
shamans.
