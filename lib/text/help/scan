SCAN

Usage: ^gSCAN <direction>^n

Scan is used to look in every room adjacent to you, through open exits but
not through closed ones. If a mob exists in any of the rooms scanned, it
will show up after you scan. Scanning is the most useful utility for
^WRanged Combat^n as it allows you to shoot mobs without being in the same
room as you. All players can only scan one room away from themselves, but
one can improve your range up to four rooms away from you with cybernetic
enhancements. The better then enhancement, the further you can see.
With enhancements, you can only scan in one direction at a time.

the analyze icon command. The target for this test is the opposing 
decker's masking and sleaze minus your scanner utility rating. This does not
