PRIORITIES

All players have 5 priority slots, labelled from A to E (highest to lowest,
respectively), and 5 priorities: attributes, magic, race, resources, skills.

^bAttributes/Skills:^n
The higher these are placed, the more attribute/skill points you will have
when you begin the game.

^bMagic:^n
Spell casters (^Wmages^n and ^Wshamans^n) must have magic as their highest
available priority (A for humans, B for metahumans).  Adepts have magic as
their second highest priority (B for humans, C for metahumans).

^bRace:^n
Humans can have race as any priority, and since it is completely irrelevant,
it is automatically placed in priority E.  Metahumans, however, must have
race as priority A.

^bResources:^n
The higher the slot this is given, the more nuyen and force points you will
have.  Nuyen is used to purchase starting equipment, and force points are
used to learn starting spells.
