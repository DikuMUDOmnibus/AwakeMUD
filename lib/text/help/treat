TREAT

Usage: ^gTREAT <victim>^n

This will attempt to treat a wounded person other than oneself.  It utilises
the ^Wbiotech^n skill, and a rather large target modifier is applied for those
without a medkit.  If successful, however, the victim will recover a varying
number of physical points.  When administered (regardless of whether it is
successful or not), the treated character may not be treated again, by
anyone, for some time.
