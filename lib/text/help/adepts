ADEPTS

Adepts are true warriors of an age past, devoted to perfecting their physical
strengths and capabilities.  Berserkers, ninjas and all other elite forms of
mortal warriors are adepts.  An adept has a magic rating, but rather than
casting spells, uses their magic to "purchase" skills and abilities that come
from a refining of the human body.  Adepts are also much more athletic and
agile than most other warriors, thus making just as good assassins as
samurais without the aid of cyberware.
