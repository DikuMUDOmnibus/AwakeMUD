HOBGOBLIN

The hobgoblins of the Middle East are smaller and slighter than most
ork variants.  Hobgoblins' greenish skin tones, sharp teeth, and
dark beady eyes give them a fierce appearance, which has contributed
to the general anti-metahuman prejudice in the Middle East.
Hobgoblins are also distinguished by their vicious tempers and
strong sense of personal honor, which demands that hobgoblins avenge
any slight or disrespect directed at them.
