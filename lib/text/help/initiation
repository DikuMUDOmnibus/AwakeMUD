INITIATION INITIATE

Initiation is a magician's way of advancement, whether the magician
be a shaman, mage, or adept.  When your character is initiated, its
magic rating increases by one point.

To attain initiation, one must be given a quest from an immortal of
Fixer level or higher.  You must seek this initiation in-character,
and not hassle the immortals over the OOC channel.  Initiation is
attained from in-character deeds, not out of character pushiness.
You must also have the karma required for the initiation level you
are trying to reach.

The karma required for each level is 3 times your base (unmodified)
magic attribute score.  This table should show how it works.
