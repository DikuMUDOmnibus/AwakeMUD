IC ICE

Interference Countermeasures, or IC, are computer programs designed to
protect a system from hackers. IC may be installed in any system with
a node rating of ^ggreen^n or higher. Every IC has a rating, which is
it's skill and target number for any tests made against it. There are
three classes of IC: White, Gray, and Black. White IC are passive and
only act as doorway guards. Gray IC actively attacks intruders or traces
their entry point into the Matrix. Black IC will try and actually kill
deckers.
