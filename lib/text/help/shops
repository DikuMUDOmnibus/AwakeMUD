SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase ^Wequipment^n for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your ^Warmor^n, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire ^Winventory^n of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.
