KOBOROKURU

Japanese dwarves, called ^Wkoborokuru^n, are slightly smaller than
their western counterparts and possess extensive body hair.  Like
other metahumans, koborokuru are not looked upon kindly in Japanese
society.  In fact, Japanese anti-metahuman prejudice has saddled
koborokuru with an undeserved reputation as rude and primitive
individuals.  Like gnomes, koborokuru prefer rural and wilderness
areas over urban environments.
