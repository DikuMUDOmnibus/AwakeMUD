DESCRIPTION

Your character's description is how your character looks, of course.
We don't want to give you too many rules to cramp your style or ruin
your own expression, but we will give you some pointers here for what
we are looking for:

The senses:
The most important senses regarding a character's description are sight
and smell, as they would be in essence what the other characters, would
see and smell in your presence.

Top to bottom describing:
Doesn't have to be in that or any other given order, but we would prefer
if all the major aspects of the character's "look" were described here.
What color is his/her eyes?  What is her/his build like?  "Is he/she
a short, stout elf or a tall slender dwarf, or just average?" Does she or
he have any distinguishing marks, such as scars, tattoos, et cetera?
If so what do they look like?  What color is her or his hair, if she or he
has any at all?  What is his or her manner of dress?  Is she or he neat
and tidy in appearance, or is he or she ragged and grungy in appearance?
