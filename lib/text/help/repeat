! |

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use | to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "|old-string|replacement"  For example:

^c< 10P 10M > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?^n
^yNo-one by that name here.^n

^c< 10P 10M > |rasmusse|rasmussen^n
^yYou tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'^n

^c< 10P 10M > |you|you doing|^n
^yYou tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'^n
