CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Danny Baker, for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Brett Turner, for managing the CircleMUD Mailing List.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- And, of course, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
