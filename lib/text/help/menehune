MENEHUNE

The ^Wmenehune^n, or Children of the Land, are named for the
original "little people" of Hawai'i.  Menehune are shorter than most
dwarves and possess luxuriant body hair, thick muscles, large noses,
bushy eyebrows, and stringy hair.  According to local legends, the
menehune's ancestors came from the lost continent of Mu, or
Atlantis, but modern biologists and anthropologists place little
stock in such fables.
