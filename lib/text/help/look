LOOK

For studying your surroundings.

Examples:
^c< 10P 10M > look                                      
< 10P 10M > look AT angel   (or just: look angel)
< 10P 10M > look IN bag     
< 10P 10M > look to south   (or just: look south)^n

Note that if you LOOK AT CORPSE you will not see its inventory.
To see what's inside a container (i.e. a corpse) use LOOK IN <OBJECT>.
