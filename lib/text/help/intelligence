INTELLIGENCE

Intelligence is an attribute which represents everything from you aptitude
level, how fast you think, and how well you perceive your environment.  For
this reason, intelligence is important because it affects your ^Wreaction^n.  You
may be quick, but if you can't think fast, it won't do you much good.  As for
^Wmages^n and ^Wshamans^n, intelligence affects how well they perform in astral space
as it is their astral ^Wquickness^n rating.  Intelligence also allows you to 
notice things in your environment that others wouldn't, such as the red dot
from someone's laser sight on your best friend's head.
