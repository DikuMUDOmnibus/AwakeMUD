DEFENSE

Usage: ^gDEFENSE <value>^n

This will assign the specified number of dice from your combat pool
specifically for defense (the rest is automatically assigned to offense).
Note that the number of dice you can allocate to the defense pool depends on
your skill with the weapons you are wielding.  The greater the skill, the
greater the number of dice that can be assigned to offense.
