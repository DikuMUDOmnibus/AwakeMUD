"COMBAT POOL"

The Combat pool applies to all players in Shadowrun. The pool represents the
extra attention a player gives to their offensive or defensive posture. The
pool can be used to increase your chance of success in any combat related tests
such as ^WFirearms^n, ^WEdged Weapons^n, or any other similar tests. The Combat
Pool is equal to a character's ^WQuickness^n, ^WIntelligence,^n and ^WWillpower^n
divided by two, rounded down.
