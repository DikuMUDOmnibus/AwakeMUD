QUICKNESS

Quickness represents your ability to move quickly (obvious, neh?) and dodge
things.  With a high quickness you can dodge bullets, swords, arrows, and
other dangerous things.  Quickness also affects your ^Wreaction^n, allowing
you to get more attacks per round.  If you are a ^Wdecker^n, quickness also
affects your hacking ability.
