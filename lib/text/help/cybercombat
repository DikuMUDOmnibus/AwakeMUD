CYBERCOMBAT

Combat in the Matrix operates much the same as combat in the real world.
It moves in turns, the opponents' reaction and initiative totals
determining who goes in what order. Wired reflexes and magical
advancement have no effect on the Decker's attributes in the Matrix.
Only response increases will increase a Decker's attributes (+2 Rea
+1D6 Initiative/per level).

When you attack an IC, you use the IC's rating as your target number.
You first need to succeed in executing the utility, depending on the
^WSecurity Rating^n and the rating of your Computer skill. Once the
program is executed, you attack the IC accordingly. The higher the 
rating of your attack program, the more damage you can possibly do. 
The higher the rating of the IC, the more resilient it will be to damage.

All IC react differently to attacks, be sure to learn from experience
to ensure you never make the same mistake twice.
