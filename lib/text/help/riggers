Riggers are a character type, whose cyberware allows them to connect to
machines in a full sensory manner, becoming one with the machine.  The
machine types that they can connect to are drones and vehicles, making
them formidable on the highways, and formidable in circumstances where
they can remotely control a vehicle or a drone, using a remote control
