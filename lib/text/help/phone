PHONE CALL HANGUP ANSWER TALK

Phones, be they cellular, cybernetic, home or office phone 
or public, all serve the same purpose as they do in real life.  
Public phones function as the others, except you can not turn 
them on or off, turn on or off the ringer, or dial into them 
from another phone.  You must be carrying a phone, have a commlink 
(cybernetic phone) installed, or be in a public phone to use 
these commands.  Please note the useage of phones is IC only, and 
the old tell system is now only used OOCly to communicate with 
immortal staff members, although you no longer require a phone to use it.

The commands for using a phone are as follows:
phone <on|off|ring|silent>.

"phone" with no arguments will show you the number of your 
telephone, whether it is on or off, and whether it is set to 
ring or is silent.  "phone on" and "phone off" turn the 
phone on or off, depending on which of the two you type :)  
"phone ring" sets the phone so that it will ring if someone calls 
you, whereas "phone silent" will not, although the phone is 
still turned on.

hangup
Hangs up the current call, whether you dialed someone else, 
or they dialed you.

answer
Use this command to answer an incoming call from another person.

talk <message>
This is how you talk on a phone.  You must be engaged in a phone 
call to use this command.
