SAVE

Save your character.  This includes experience points, strength, credits, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your character still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find a hotel to store your belongings.
