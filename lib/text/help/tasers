TASERS

The taser skill determines your ability to use a taser effectively.  
Generally, they fire a small dart with a wire connected to it.  Once the
dart makes contact, an electrical charge flows down the wire, rendering
the victim unconscious.  This is often times a weapon favored by police
in low-threat situations.
