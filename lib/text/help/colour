COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

^c< 10P 10M > color off^n
This command disables all color.

^c< 10P 10M > color sparse
< 10P 10M > color normal
< 10P 10M > color complete^n

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.
