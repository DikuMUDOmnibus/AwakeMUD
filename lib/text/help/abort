ABORT

Test: CONTROL
Utility: SWERVE
Usage: ^gABORT^N

This command is used to abort or delay a host shutdown, either
triggered by another decker or by the security sheave. If you score
twice as many successes as the decker who initiated the shutdown
you will abort it completly, otherwise it will just be delayed.
Shutdowns triggered by a security sheave cannot be stopped, only
delayed.
