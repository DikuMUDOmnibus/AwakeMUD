EAGLE

Eagle shamans are proud and strong, and intolerant of ignoble or base actions.
Those who would destroy the environment are particular targets of Eagle's
wrath. Eagle's vantage point makes detection easier and improves
communication with spirits of the wind. The Eagle shaman hates technology,
particularly the invasive kind.
