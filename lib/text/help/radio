RADIO

Radios are necessary for wide-range communication.  The "radio" command can
be used to change the mode of one's cybernetic or standard radio.

^cradio^n

Lists the current settings of your radio.

^cradio off^n

Turns your radio off, making it impossible to send and receive broadcasts.

^cradio scan^n

Sets your radio to scan mode, where it can receive broadcasts from all
frequencies but not send any.

^cradio center <frequency>^n

Centers your radio around the given frequency.  Broadcasts within the radio's
range of the centered frequency will be received, and any broadcasts sent
will be at the centered frequency.

^cradio crypt <level | off>^n

Turns the radio's crypt mode on or off.  With crypt mode on, only other
radios with a crypt rating greater than or equal to yours will receive your
broadcasts (note: others' crypt does not need to be on to decrypt incoming
messages).
