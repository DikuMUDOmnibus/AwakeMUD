ARCHETYPES

Archetypes are a way to generalize which skills a character will learn.
Though we all can attempt to learn just about anything, people are either
born with certain abilities which cannot be learned later in life (such
as ^Wmagic^n), and they also make choices in childhood which limit their
later choices.  We feel archetypes represent this and career choices.

Archetypes are only important for the beginning stages of a character's
development.  Afterwards, the character is distinguished by its skills,
attributes, and reputation -- not by what it began as.
