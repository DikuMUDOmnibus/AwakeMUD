PROJECT

This allows a mage or a shaman to project themselves into the Astral Plane. They
effectively leave their bodies and exist on two planes at once, although they
can only control their bodies in the Astral Plane. While projected, player's
physical bodies are extremely vulnerable and it is not advisable to be alone or
in unknown territory while projecting.
