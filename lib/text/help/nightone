"NIGHT ONES" "NIGHT-ONES"

A mostly european metavariant of elves, known by their own choice as
the Night Ones, possesses the distinguishing physical characteristic
of a fine fur covering their bodies.  This layer of fur is
indistinguishable from skin at a distance, but the fact that the fur
ranges in color from black to violet to blue, with some rare
examples of green and deep orange, makes this metavariant quickly
apparant at close range.  The Night Ones' hair and eyes are usually
a tint of their skin color though a few rare Night Ones have silver
hair and eyes.

Because the most common colors of fur are the dark shades, the
general public almost immediately dubbed these elves the Dark Elves.
Despite popular urban myth however, the Night Ones are not a cult or
an "evil" elven subgroup.
