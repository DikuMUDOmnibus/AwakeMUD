CREATE

Usage: ^gCREATE <mage/shaman/program>^n

Because ^Wmages^n and ^Wshamans^n follow two different paths, both require slightly
different methods to create a spell.  A ^Wmage^n must know ^Wmagical theory^n and
can only create a spell in a hermetic library.  A ^Wshaman^n, on the other hand,
must know shamanic studies and work in a medicine lodge to create a spell.
The maximum force any spell created can be is determined by the level of
knowledge either path has.  For example, a ^Wmage^n who was average in ^Wmagical
theory^n would only be able to create a spell with a maximum force of about
4.

Once you have met these requirements, you will be taken to a menu system
which will allow you to design a spell.  Each spell has several parts which
must be set before the spell formula is valid.  An example spell follows:

^m   Drain: 3S
1) Spell name: manabolt
2) Type: Mana
3) Category: Combat
4) Force: 6
5) Target: Ranged
6) Effects: None
7) Base Damage: Serious
q) Quit
Enter your choice:^n

Menu item 1 obviously allows you to name the spell what you chose.  The
second menu item will allow you chose between the two types of spells,
mana or physical.  Mana spells can only target living beings, while physical
spells can affect anything.  Item 3 allows you to chose between the five
categories of spells.  The categories are combat, detection, illusion, health,
and manipulation.  Each spell category determines what effects a spell may
include.  Menu item 4 lets you set the force of the spell, up to a maximum of
your skill in ^Wmagical theory^n (if you're a ^Wmage^n) or shamanic studies (if
you're a ^Wshaman^n).  Item 5 lets you determine what target the spell may be
cast at. There are four basic targets:  caster, touch, ranged, and area.
The first means the spell can only be cast on the caster.  Touch is
designed for spell in which a touch is required.  Ranged will target
anything within sight. Area is similar to ranged in that it will target
anything in sight, however it will affect an area (such as a group of mobs).
Item 6 lets you chose the actual effects of the spell (many of which may
be combined).  As a side note, a combat spell may have NO effects as its
category determines what its primary effect is (damage).  Adding effects
to a combat spell will mainly add extra effects beyond damage to the
spell, such as fire, ice, etc.  Finally, Item 7 (which is only available
for combat spells) determines the base damage for the spell.

Once these features have been determined by you, quitting will allow you
to write the spell as a formula which may then be learned.

To create a program you only need to follow the simple menu. This will
leave you with a program design which must be installed on a desktop
computer. You cannot create a program with a rating higher than you
computer skill.
