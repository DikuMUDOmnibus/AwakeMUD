SOCIALS

Usage: ^g<social> [<victim>]^n

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion, but it is possible that
some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social.
