SHAMANS

Shamans are people who are born with magical ability, but manipulate ^Wmagic^n
through their emotions, will, and faith in the natural world and its power.
For shamans, this connection comes through a ^Wtotem^n which personifies their
nature and has strengths and weaknesses just as they do.  This way of life
allows them to summon spirits and manipulate the magical energies of the
world.  Shamans do not view the world in a strictly logical or ordered way.  
Unlike ^Wmages^n, they prefer to improvise when casting and let their emotions 
bring out the strengths of their spells.
