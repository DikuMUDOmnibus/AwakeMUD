"ESSENCE INDEX"

Commonly confused with Essence, the Essence Index determines how many points 
of Bioware a runner's body can accept before it has adverse effects on the body.
Essence Index is determined by the current Essence rating + 3.  For example, 
someone with an Essence of 6 has an Essence Index of 9. Once Bioware exceeds the 
Essence Index, damage overflow ratings and healing rates are reduced with every 
point of Bioware that exceeds the EI.
For example, if the total bio index lost is 5 points, and your essence index is 4, 
then you lose 1 point of physical overflow damage and your healing rates are reduced.
This isn't to be confused with Essence or Bio Index, which rate how much cyberware 
or bioware your body can take before dying.
