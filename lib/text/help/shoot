SHOOT

Usage: ^gSHOOT <target> <direction>^n

This command allows you to shoot someone from a distance. You can shoot in any
of the existing directions. You can only shoot up to four rooms away, which
depends on sight magnification or eye cyberware that would allow you to see
further. You can only shoot as far as you can scan, and as far as your gun
will reach. Thus, pistols will obviously not reach as far as sniper rifles,
no matter how good your sight is. Be wary however, because some mobs will not
tolerate being shot at, and will come right after you. At the same time, others
will just turn and run. To use:
