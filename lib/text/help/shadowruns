SHADOWRUNS

Shadowruns are a runner's primary source of cash. Without them, a runner
would be nothing. Through runs you'll find cash, equipment, contacts and
much more.  Runs in Awake are automated for you, all you need do
is find a ^WJohnson^n. They will then give you work. Certain keywords
are used in getting a job. These are:

 - Job, run, work, accept, quit, complete, collect, yes, no

As time goes on, Johnsons will be more flexible in comprehending what you're
trying to get across.  Just recently, they gained the intelligence to
understand basic gestures ("nod" and "shake" specifically).
