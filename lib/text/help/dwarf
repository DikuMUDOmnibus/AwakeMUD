DWARF DWARVES "HOMO SAPIENS PUMILIONIS"

Average Height: 1.2 meters (3.9 feet)
Average Weight: 54 kilograms (118 pounds)
Features: Legs are disproportionately short, giving them a disadvantage at
          any skill requiring speed of foot.  Their torsos are very wide at
          the shoulder, allowing them greater strength than that of a ^Whuman^n.
          Body hair is full, and head hair is almost extreme.  Their noses
          tend to be long and large, while their ears are slightly pointed.
          They have 32 teeth.  Their eyes are sensitive to the infrared
          spectrum allowing them to function in darkness.  Their phenotypes
          show an increased resistence to pathogens.  Skin color ranges from
          pinkish-white or light tan, though some species range to ebony.
Habitat:  The dwaven subspecies prefers artifical or natural caverns in
          wilderness areas, while prefering basements or underground
          dwellings in urban areas.
Habits:   Dwarves are active in both day or night, and their diet is 
          omnivorous. Their breeding season is unrestricted.  The gestation
          period is 284 days.  Young are usually 5.6 percent of the mother's
          weight, and the suckling time is more than 15 months.  Metabolic
          studies cannot verify the lifespan of dwarves, but data shows it
          may be more than a hundred years.
