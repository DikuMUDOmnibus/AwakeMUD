PISTOLS

Pistol skill governs your ability to use pistols of all sizes.  Most places
allow you to carry a light or hold-out type pistol.  Standard pistols allow
you to mount barrel and top mounting accessories only.  Revolvers cannot
use silencers or sound suppressers, while hold-out pistols cannot mount any
accessories.
