INDEX

The ^Windex^n command allows you to view the index for this set of help
files.  Two forms of the command are available.

Typing:
^cindex^n

by itself, will display the entire index.

^cindex <letter>^n

will display a list of all words in the help files which begin with that
particular letter.
