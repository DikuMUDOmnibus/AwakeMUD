Features: Though the nobilis is more slender than sapiens, their bone
          structure and musculature is equally strong.  Body hair is sparse,
          though head hair is luxuriant and fine.  Head hair is also usually
          straight or slightly wavy, and almost always worn long (however,
          there are several populations showing tightly curled head hair).
          Their eyes are almond shaped, and ears come to a definite point.
          Further, their eyes have more rod structures than sapiens, allowing
          them to see well in dim light.  Elves have 32 teeth.  Skin color
          ranges from pale pink to white or ebony.
Habitat:  Elves live in standard housing in urban areas, but in the 
          wilderness they prefer living is structures created of natural 
          materials or living plants.
Habits:   They are nocturnal beings, and their diet is vegetarian.  The life
          expectancy of elves is unverified, and metabolic tests are 
          inconclusive, but possibly spans several hundred years.  Their 
          breeding season is unrestricted, and gestation period is 360 days.
          Young are 5.2 percent of the mother's weight, with a suckling time
          of more than 25 months.
