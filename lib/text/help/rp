ROLEPLAYING RP "ROLE PLAYING"

Roleplay (rOl'-plA) (v): To act out, to play a role.

Awake 2062 is a roleplaying MUD.  Which means, for all intents and purposes,
you are acting-out your character.  This is defined as being "in-character".
  You are not your character, you are pretending to be your character.
Playing the role of your character. All communication in says, emotes,
tells, and radio channels is considered in-character.  Any actions done or
taken , not using ^Sosay^T or ^Sooc^T, are considered in-character.  Other
players and immortals may use these actions for, or against, your character.
  Caution should be exercised when doing things in Awake2062.  Actions have
consequences, some beneficial, others detrimental.
"Out-of-character" is defined as anything that is outside of your character,
such as who you are in real life, your job in real life, your computer, your
tastes, etc.  We have the "osay" and "ooc" commands for out-of-character
communication.
