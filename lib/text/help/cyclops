CYCLOPS

Greek and Mediterranean trolls, known as cyclops are often larger
and more heavily muscled than other trolls.  They lack most of the
dermal bone deposits common among trolls, but are most easily
distinguished by the fact that they only have one single eye located
in the middle of their foreheads.  All cyclopes either have only one
horn, or in rare instances, no horns.

Cyclopes receive a +2 target number penalty to all ranged combat
tests.
