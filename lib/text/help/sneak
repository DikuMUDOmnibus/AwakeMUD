SNEAK

Sneaking is used to prevent others from noticing you entering and leaving
areas, and is based off your ^Wstealth^n skill.  When you sneak, you move as
quietly as possible and as out of sight as possible.  Once you begin
sneaking, you will continue until you either begin combat or you decide to
stop.
