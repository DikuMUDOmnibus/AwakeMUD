CUSTOMIZE

This allows you to customize the two descriptions you may have in Awake: your
Astral Reflection, your physical appearance, and your Matrix Persona. With
this command, you can customize all of their characteristics.

^c< 10P 10M > customize reflection^n
^c< 10P 10M > customize persona^n
^c< 10P 10M > customize physical^n

^C1) Alias:^n
This is for the keywords that will work for interaction with others in
the same room as you.  Always make sure your name is one of the aliases
in the list.

^C2) Short Description:^n
This is what you will appear as, the 'name' of you in the room.  This is
not the same as your character name, in fact it is preferred to be
something descriptive of your character, like for example:

^cA hairy stout elf with yellow eyes^n

^C3) Room Description:^n
This is what people will see when they glance in a room that you are
present in.  Like for example:

^cA hairy elf covered in tattoos is standing here.^n

If you are customizing your physical description, this is replaced with
voice. For example:

^cA deep throaty male voice^n

^C4) Look Description:^n
This is the description people will see when they look directly at you.
We suggest you go crazy with your creativity and make a nice description
that covers many details about your character.

To end the description editors, you simply type '@' alone on
the last line.  To exit the customize menu type 'q' to quit.
