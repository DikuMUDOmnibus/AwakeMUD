WRITE

In order to write a note, you need a piece of blank paper (or similar), and
a pen of some sort. You can then type something like "write on the paper with
the pen", whereupon you'll be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.

WRITE is also used to post messages to bulletin boards, referred to in this
game as ^Wterminals^n.
