"CONTROL POOL"

The control pool is a measure of a rigger's reaction plus
twice the rigger's vehicle control rig rating.  It is used in addition
to the rigger's vehicle skill, up to the skill level
(i.e. if the rigger had a Driving/Car skill of 4 and a control pool of
six, the rigger would only be able to use 4 dice from his/her control
pool.)
