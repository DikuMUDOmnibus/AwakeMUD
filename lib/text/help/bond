BOND

Bond has two purposes: to personalize DocWagon modulators or to bond magical
foci.  Anyone can use this to accomplish the former, and the syntax for doing
so is:

^gBOND <modulator>^n

Those who follow the hermetic (^Wmages^n) or shamanic (^Wshamans^n) traditions
can use this command with any types of ^WFoci^n they may have.  In addition,
adepts may use this to bond only weapon foci.  This will use some karma, the
amount depending on the type of focus and the level of the focus itself. The
more powerful the focus, the more expensive it is to bond. Once bonded, the
two items cannot be detached. To use it:

^gBOND <focus> <spell/category/spirit/weapon>^n

^c< 10P 10M > bond focus "combat sense"^n
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus sword^n
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus "earth elemental"^n
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus combat^n
