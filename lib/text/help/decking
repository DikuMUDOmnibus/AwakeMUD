DECKING

Decker's or Hackers' livelihood. Deckers hack into the ^WMatrix^n and surfing
through the huge net of information, search for anything of use to themselves
or their fellow Shadowrunners. Decking is an essential element in cracking
security or stealing large sums of untracable cash, as the economy of the world
now runs on computers.
