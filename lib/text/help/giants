GIANTS

Nordic trolls, or giants, are fairer and taller than most other
trolls.  The average giant stands 3.5 meters tall, and most lack
horns and other dermal bone deposits common to their race.  For
as-yet-unknown reasons, giants seem to have a greater-than-average
tendency towards genetic reversions.  One out of every four female
infants born to giant mothers is human.
