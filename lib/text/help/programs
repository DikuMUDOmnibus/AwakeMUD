PROGRAMS

All Deckers must have certain programs just for their deck to run. Programs
are much like the skeleton of the Deck, without them one cannot jack in.

There are four programs all Deckers need: ^Wbod^n, ^Wevasion^n, ^Wmasking^n and ^Wsensors^n.

The total ratings of all four programs cannot exceed three times the ^WMPCP^n
of the deck.
