SAMURAI "STREET SAMURAI"

Street samurai are people who have chosen the path of technology to work
in the city.  They are tough, if not a little insane, and proud of the
tech they augment their body with.  To them, the hottest ^Wcyberware^n and
^Wbioware^n are the tools that will bring them success.  Their environment
is the metroplex.
