BODY

Your Body attribute is considered by all ^WStreet Samurai^n to be your most
important rating.  It represents your resistance to bullets, blades,
explosions, and other such physical attacks.  The higher your rating, the
less damage you will take from attacks.  As an example, Frank, a gang member,
attacks a mage who has a body of 2.  Frank, using a sword, quite easily
penatrates the mages stomach, killing him in a few swipes.  Later, Frank runs
into a Troll who has a body of 11.  Frank breaks his sword trying to scratch
the troll (who just laughs and finishes off Frank).  Hopefully, you get the
picture.
