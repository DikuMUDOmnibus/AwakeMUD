ARMOR BALLISTIC IMPACT

Your armor class has two different ratings, ballistic and impact.  With
ballistic armor you resist damage from high speed and impact weapons such as
bullets.  Impact armor on the other hand resists low speed attacks resulting
usually from melee, grenades, arrows, and similar attacks.  Ballistic armor
offers no help against impact attacks and vice-versa.  Examples of armor
classes follow:

Impact:                          Ballistic:
-------                          ----------
0  -  Basic clothing             0 - Basic clothing
1  -  Synthetic leather          1 - Armor helmet
2  -  Real leather               2 - Armor vest
3  -  Plated clothing            3 - Armor Clothing

Most armor will offer both types of protection, though some will offer only
one type.  Armor is cumulative, therefore wearing armor clothing which has
a ballistic rating of 3 and impact of 0, combined with a real leather overcoat
will create a total rating of 3/2 (ballistic/impact).
