NEWBIE NEOPHYTE 

As a newbie, you will first of all need to find a source of survival in the
Sprawl, namely food, water, and a gun. For directions on how to find some small
suppliers of such resources, look at the map help files. To get a broader overview 
of other help files, type '^WIndex.^n' Around the world of Awake, you will find 
numerous computer terminals, which link up to the worldwide neural network, 
displaying comments and information from other people in the Sprawl like yourself.
