SELL

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most ^Wshops^n specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look
around to find a buyer for your items.  By default, when you sell something,
the nuyen will be added to your personalized credstick.  If you would prefer
to receive cash, then simply insert the word "cash" after sell.
 
Examples:
 
^c< 10P 10M > sell gun         (sell the first gun in your inventory)
< 10P 10M > sell cash 3 gun    (sell the first three guns in your inventory for cash)^n
