RACES

Prior to the 21st century, people thought that races were people of
different skin colors and features. This term was redefined to mean the
different genetic expressions of ^Whumans^n which came about in the early
21st century.  With this, racism changed dramatically.  Instead of worrying
if someone with darker skin was going to hurt them, they became more
concerned about whether that 9 foot ^Wtroll^n or huge ^Work^n was gonna hurt them.
Racism is still a thing that affects society, but in this new shade.
