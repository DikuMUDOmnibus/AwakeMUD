TERMINALS

Terminals are the forum of interplayer communication on ^RAwake 2062^n.
There are different terminals for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal terminal, a terminal for immortals, a terminal for fun 
"social" messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to
read all types of terminals.

Type "look terminal" to see the messages already posted on a terminal. Type
"write <subject>" to post a message to a terminal; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "read <number>" to read a
post.  Type "read <number>" to remove your own files.  Typing "reply
<number>" will automatically start your writing a new message, with the same
header as the message you are replying to with an "Re: " appended to the
beginning.
