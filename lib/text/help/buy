BUY

If you'd like to purchase an item from a ^Wshop^n and have the money, you can
buy it.  Items can be bought by name, or by their number in the shop listing,
and can be bought in quantity.  Purchasing an item looks for a personalized
credstick by default.  If you do not have a credstick, you can also pay for
something with cash.

Examples:

^c< 10P 10M > buy gun          (buy the first gun on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy #3           (buy the third item on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy 4.gun        (buy the fourth gun on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy 10 ration    (buy 10 rations)
< 10P 10M > buy 10 #2        (buy 10 of the second item on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy cash 10 #2   (buy 10 of the second item on the list with cash)^n
