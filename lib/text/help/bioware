BIOWARE

Bioware is a type of organically grown equipment, much like Cyberware only
it does not have an essence cost. There are various items of Bioware around
in the game, all having strange side affects and advantages. The amount of
Bioware you can have is measured by your "Body Index", which begins at 6.
When you buy Bioware, your body value does not go down, it is simply used as
a gauge. To measure what your body index is, add up the costs of all your
bioware and subtract it from 6.

The command ^RBioware^r will display any bioware you have currently installed.

Bioware is notoriously incredibly expensive.
