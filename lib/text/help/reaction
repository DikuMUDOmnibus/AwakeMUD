REACTION

Your reaction attribute is a rating of how well and how quick you act 
under pressure.  It helps you gain more attacks during battle, it helps
^Wdeckers^n work better in cyberspace, and it helps ^Wmages^n and ^Wshamans^n fight
better in astral space.  This attribute can only be raised by increasing
your ^Wintelligence^n and ^Wquickness^n, because it is a determined by adding
those two attributes, and dividing by 2.  For the combat intensive person,
reaction is very important if you wish to gain multiple attacks.
