ORKS "HOMO SAPIENS ROBUSTUS"

Average Height: 1.9 meters (6.2 feet)
Average Weight: 95 kilograms (209 pounds)
Features: The ork body is proportionately similar to sapiens, however they
          are more heavily built.  Hair is more prominent than sapiens.
          Robustus lips tend to be thin, and noses tend to be broad.  Their 
          ears show a definite point and are sometimes elongated.  Like
          ingentis, the appearances of robustus tend to vary greatly, leading
          scientists to believe there are several sub-species.  The high
          proportion of rod over cone structures allow vision in low light.
          Their skulls have 32 teeth with greatly enlarged lower canines.
Habitat:  Like sapiens, robustus prefers roofed dwellings.
Habits:   Though orks operate in both day and night, they seem to prefer
          night. Their diet is omnivorous, but have a preference for meat.
          Metabolic studies show the lifespans to be from 35 to 40 years.
          Their breeding season is unrestricted, with a gestation period of
          187 days.  Ork mothers tend to bear 4 children, though births of 6
          and 8 are not uncommon.  Birth weight is 4.2 percent of mother's
          weight, and suckling time is more than 7 months.  Young born as
          sapiens have a 95 percent chance to genetically become robustus at
          puberty.  Such young have severe psychoses and aberrant behavioral
          patterns.
