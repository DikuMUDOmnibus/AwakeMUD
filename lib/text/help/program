PROGRAM

Usage: ^gPROGRAM <program>^n

This command is used to begin programming a cyberdeck utility.
If you have previously prepared a design plan it will make 
programming the utility far easier than without. You must have
the program installed on a desktop computer and be sitting in
the room to use this command.
