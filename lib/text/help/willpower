WILLPOWER

Willpower represents the strength of your mind, in other words, your mental
stability, determination, and your self control.  For a ^Wmage^n or ^Wshaman^n this
can be one of the most important stats because it represents their astral
strength and it helps them resist drain from ^Wspells^n.  If you are a mundane, 
willpower helps you resist mana type spells (spells which attack the mind
to cause damage).  During the late 1980's and 1990's many people were addicted
to network text games called 'muds' (multi-user dungeons).  Obviously those
people had low willpower.
