ALERTS

There are two different types of Alert in all Matrix systems: Passive and
Active.

PASSIVE - This is triggered when the system detects a Decker attempting
anything illegal. This is usually when the security tally rises above a
certain level. On a passive alert, all IC in the system have %50 added 
to their ratings, but remain invisible and peaceful. The length of any
alert depends on how much extra activity has happened after it was triggered
and the security rating of the host.

ACTIVE - An active alert can only be triggered if a Passive Alert has been
already triggered. In an Active alert, all IC become visible and aggressive.
