TROLLS "HOMO SAPIENS INGENTIS"

Average Height: 2.8 meters (9.1 feet)              
Average Weight: 225 kilograms (495 pounds)
Features: Skin color varies from pinkish-white to mahogany brown, and usually
          remains changed after ingentisization (transformation into troll
          form).  Ingentis' body proportions include a very high arm to leg
          length ratio.  Trolls are very heavily built and often times     
          exhibit dermal bone deposits (resulting in spines and a rough
          texture to skin).  Body hair is well developed, but may be absent
          completely.  Ears show definite points and are sometimes elongated.
          Their sloped skull has 34 teeth with enlarged canines.  Their molars
          show extreme convolutions which researches believe indicate that
          ingentis' teeth constantly regenerate.  Their eyes are sensitive to
          the infrared portion of the spectrum allowing them to operate
          freely in darkness.  Like robustus, ingentis varries in appearance
          greately which may indicate several subspecies.
Habitat:  Trolls living in the wilderness tend to use caverns and converted
          structures such as buildings for dwelling.  In urban areas, they
          prefer areas such as sewers and derelict buildings.
Habits:   Trolls prefer night, and their diet is omnivorous. Metabolic
          studies show ingentis life expectancy to about 50 years.  Gestation
          period is 259 days, with a suckling time of more than 15 months.    
          Birth weight is 2.5 percent of mother's weight.  As robustus, young
          born as sapiens will 95% of the time genetically express into   
          ingentis. This transformation usually causes extreme psychoses and
          abberant behavior.
