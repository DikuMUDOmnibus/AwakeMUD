CONJURE

Usage: ^gCONJURE <force> <spirit/elemental>^n

Hermetic ^Wmages^n can only conjure elementals, and must be in a hermetic library
to do so.  ^WShamans^n can summon a variety of spirits, and exactly what
spirits they can conjure depends on the type of environment they are in.

Once conjured, spirits and elementals can be ^Wordered^n to perform certain
tasks.  The number of tasks depends on the force of the spirit/elemental.
Another thing to note is that taking a spirit outside of its natural domain
will cause the spirit to be banished.

Elementals:
Air, Earth, Fire, Water.

Spirits:
City, Hearth, Field, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Prairie, Mist, Storm, Lake,
River, Sea, Swamp.
