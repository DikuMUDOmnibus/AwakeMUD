HOTEL HOTELS RECEPTION

Hotels are places where the weary traveler may rest while the establishment
looks after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on which hotel you rent at, and not
your equipment.  Hotels across Seattle have agreed to rent rooms out for
free after ten days.
