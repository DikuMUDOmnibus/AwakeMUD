WAKYAMBI

The ^Wwakyambi^n are an extremely rare elven subgroup native to               
Africa.  The wakyambi often lack pointed ears and are noticeably          
thinner and taller than other elves, sometimes growing as tall as
trolls and a rare few even taller.  Wakyambi almost always possess
black or brown skin, though rare albino wakyambi are known to exist,
characterized by white skin, no body hair and red eyes.  All known
albino wakyambi shun the modern world and live deep within the
jungles of the African heartland.
