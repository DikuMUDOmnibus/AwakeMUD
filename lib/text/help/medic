MEDIC

A medic utility repairs damage to the persona. The higher the program's
rating, the greater the chance of extensive repair. A medic utility
degrades after use, but the rating can be restored by loading in a fresh
copy from storage memory during the run. The greater the damage done, the
harder it is for the Medic to heal.
