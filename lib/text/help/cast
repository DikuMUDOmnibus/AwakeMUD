CASTING CAST

Usage: ^gCAST [x] 'spell name' [target] [where]^n 

The first value x, before the spell name, determines the force at which the
spell will be cast.  This may be a number from 1 to the force of the spell
which has been learned.  Leaving out this argument defaults the spell to the
maximum force you can cast the spell at.

The last arguments following the spell name determine the target of the spell.
Objects and people are generally the targets of spells, but the actual target
is largely determined by the spell category.  However, due to the nature of
^Wmagic^n, all targets generally have to be seen by the caster.

Several examples follow using a standard combat spell called 'stunbolt'.

^c< 10P 10M > cast 'stunbolt'^n
This form of casting is valid only during combat because the
target will default to whoever you are fighting with.  It is useful
to keep you from accidentally casting the spell at the wrong person
during combat.

^c< 10P 10M > cast 'stunbolt' sean^n
This form is standard for casting a spell at a mob and would cast 'stunbolt'
at the maximum force a player learned the spell at.

^c< 10P 10M > cast 3 'stunbolt' sean north^n
This form would cast a force 3 'stunbolt' at Sean, who is in a visible room to
the north.
