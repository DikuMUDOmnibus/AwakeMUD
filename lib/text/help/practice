PRACTICE PRACTISE

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to
your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.

If you type practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and
how good you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.
