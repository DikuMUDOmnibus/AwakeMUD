AT

Usage: ^gAT <mob/player> <commands>^n

This command allows the user to perform an action, in a room that he is not
physically in. This command, albeit near impossible to explain, is incredible
fun.  For example, if you were in room 1234 and Pook was in room 4065:

^c< 10P 10 M > at pook lick pook^n

- You would not move, but Pook would see "Bob licks you."

This command can be used with commands such as look, kill, etc.
