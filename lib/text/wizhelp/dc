DC

Usage: ^gDC <player/*>^n

This disconnects a user from the MUD itself. The command is used by typing
"dc" and then the name of the player.  There is also "dc *", which
disconnects all connected sockets which do not hold playing characters.
This command is not to be abused, with result of severe punishment. It is
used only for dire situations or other circumstances that call for the
disconnection of a player.
