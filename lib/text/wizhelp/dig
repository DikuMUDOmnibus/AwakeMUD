DIG

Usage: ^gDIG <direction> <room vnum>^n

This command creates a two-way exit between two rooms. You dig between
the room you are standing in, and another. Dig then creates an exit
automatically. Dig cannot be used to make exits to ^WMatrix^n hosts, and all
doors need to be edited manually in ^WRedit^n.

^C< 10P 10M > dig east 1003^n
