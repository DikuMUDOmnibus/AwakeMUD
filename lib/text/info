Awake 2062 is a Shadowrun RP MUD.  It is not a mush or mux, it does not
shut people out for choosing a type of character, if it is well within
the confines of Shadowrun Third Edition, and if our code has features to
support this type of character out of character generation.

Awake 2062 is Shadowrun before it is a MUD.  We suggest that you purchase
a copy of the Shadowrun Third Edition core rules, referred to in this manifesto
as the BBB from this point on. (BBB = Big Black Book).  If you do not currently
own a copy, we suggest that you purchase one before you get into the game here.

Awake 2062 is a Roleplaying Encouraged MUD. We heavily encourage you to particpate
in any player or immortal run RP session. Bonuses will be rewarded to players
who put in an effort, with a team of hardworking quest staff and mortal RPEs
keeping watch over you.

Awake 2062's rules, RP positions, and gamemaster decisions are on the terms
of the Awake 2062 staff.  Your only right when signing onto this mud is the
right to close your mud client window and not come back.

Awake 2062's staff will not tolerate under any circumstances, badgering
or bullying other players out of character.  And in-character, if the actions
are considered too morally reprehensible to even ROLEPLAY, (rape, sexual
harassment), we will happily take the offending character out of the game.

You are here on our terms.  If you disagree with our terms, disconnect now.

Welcome to Awake 2062.
