^Wo^N Ban Evasion, Log-Spamming, etc.
    These are common sense rules, but many people completely lack such 
    things.  Evading bans by logging in thru a router, telnet proxy, shell
    account or other method is a blatant breach of all Awake policy.  Spamming
    logs as well is illegal.  Your ISP will be reported to.  If your ISP is
    false and your hostmask is false, then we will report hacking to the
    United States or Canadian authorities.  We will also report the owners
    of whatever proxy or router used the alleged abuse.  Anyone aiding or
    abetting a ban evader, log-spammer, code exploitor, or the like will
    be considered by policy as guilty as them.


^Wo^n Impersonation
    Impersonating immortals, mobs, or players with the customize
    command is a breach of Awake policy.  Immortals may ask you to change
    your descriptions for any given reason.  Descriptions should be appropriate
    for your character.


^Wo^n Policy Addendums
    Anything written as policy in a help file or the message of the day (type
    motd to read) is considered policy in addendum to this file.

++ All policys are open to change without notice.
