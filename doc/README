Welcome to AwakeMUD - The first Shadowrun-based Diku Public Codebase.
The game mechanics are set to work according to the Shadowrun Second
Edition rules.

Basically this version of AwakeMUD is works on these known systems:

Requirements:
32 MB RAM
50 MB hard disk space
glibc 2.1 to current (libc6)

Red Hat 5.1-2, 6.x
Mandrake 6.x, 7.x 
SuSE 6.x
Debian 2.1, 2.2, woody
Slackware 7, using kernel 2.4.x (my home box)
I am pretty sure it will run on Slackware 7+ any kernel version... but you
never can be sure...
FreeBSD, when using gnu make
(might have to make some hacks.  AwakeMUD originally ran on FreeBSD 3.?
however, it moved to a linux box and was modified a bit.)

The autorun script is designed to run AwakeMUD under gdb for debugging purposes.
Changes to the script can be made easily to disable this.

The /doc/CircleMUD3 folder is set aside to store the original Circle MUD 3.0
Documents that came with the version of Circle 3 that AwakeMUD is based on.
 
Anywho, I am gonna work my ass off to make sure this thing stays well
documented.  Don't blame me for the code being commented poorly however, as
that was the coders' work not mine.
